# bfn

A web framework, used like function

The web framework [compatible with fresh](https://bfn-fresh.deno.dev/),fork from fresh

[Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) is a web framework that lets you build projects very fast, highly dynamic,
and without the need of a build step. Fresh embraces isomorphic JavaScript like
never before. Write a JSX component, have it render on the edge just-in-time,
and then enhance it with client side JS for great interactivity.

Fresh does not have a build step - you write your code, deploy it to
[Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy), and from there everything is handled by
the framework.

- No build step
- Zero config necessary
- JIT rendering on the edge
- Tiny (example is 0-3KB of runtime JS)<sup>1</sup>
- Optional client side hydration
- TypeScript out of the box
- File-system routing Ã  la Next.js
